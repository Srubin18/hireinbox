## Key Differentiator: Evidence-Based AI

Our "Why They Match" section with source attribution (CV/video/interview) is UNIQUE among platforms. This is our moat - lean into it harder.

Most platforms use black-box AI. We show evidence. This builds trust.

**Recommendation:** Make this more prominent. Add quotes from CV directly in the match reasons.
