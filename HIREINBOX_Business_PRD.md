## Strategic Positioning: AI Hiring Utility (NOT a Marketplace)

### The Cold-Start Problem

Traditional job boards face a chicken-and-egg problem:
- Employers won't post if there are no candidates
- Candidates won't join if there are no jobs
- Bootstrapping both sides simultaneously is expensive and slow

### Our Solution: Phase-Based Rollout

**HireInbox is NOT a job board.** We're an **AI Hiring Utility** - employers bring their own CVs, we provide AI-powered screening.

#### Phase 1: AI CV Analysis (Months 1-3)
**"Bring Your Own CVs"**
- Company creates a job role (via form OR AI avatar interview)
- Company forwards CVs to their HireInbox email address
- AI screens and scores every CV against role requirements
- Company reviews shortlist in dashboard
- **Pricing:** R1,750 per role (unlimited CVs)
- **No marketplace needed** - employer already has CVs

#### Phase 2: Job Listings (Months 4-6)
**"Post & Attract"**
- Companies can post jobs publicly on HireInbox
- Job seekers discover and apply
- All applications still screened by AI
- **Pricing:** R2,500 per job listing
- **Marketplace begins** - but we already have paying employers

#### Phase 3: Subscriptions (Month 7+)
**"All-You-Can-Hire"**
- Monthly subscription plans
- Unlimited roles and listings
- Full talent pool access
- Advanced features (AI interviews, scheduling)
- **Pricing:** R5,000-R15,000/month

### Why This Works

1. **No cold-start problem:** Phase 1 requires zero candidates
2. **Immediate value:** Employers save time on Day 1
3. **Proven demand:** Move to Phase 2 only when ready
4. **Cash flow positive:** Revenue from Day 1

### CV Ownership Model

**Critical decision:** Employer owns CVs they submit.

- CVs submitted by employer = employer's data
- To join talent pool = candidate must double opt-in
- POPIA compliant (consent-based)
- No "scraped CV" database

### Revenue Streams

### 5.5 Break-Even Analysis

**Current Trajectory Break-Even:** Month 24-30

To reach break-even faster, we need:

- Required: ~500 paying B2B customers at R750 average = R375,000
- Required: ~1,350 B2C transactions/month at R80 average = R108,000

**Accelerated Path to Break-Even (Month 18):**
- Aggressive enterprise sales (10 companies at R2,499 = R24,990/month)
- Partnership deals with recruitment agencies
- Referral program driving organic growth
- Reduced marketing spend as organic traffic grows
