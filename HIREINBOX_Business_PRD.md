## Strategic Positioning: AI Hiring Utility (NOT a Marketplace)

### The Cold-Start Problem

Traditional job boards face a chicken-and-egg problem:
- Employers won't post if there are no candidates
- Candidates won't join if there are no jobs
- Bootstrapping both sides simultaneously is expensive and slow

### Our Solution: Phase-Based Rollout

**HireInbox is NOT a job board.** We're an **AI Hiring Utility** - employers bring their own CVs, we provide AI-powered screening.

#### Phase 1: AI CV Analysis (Months 1-3)
**"Bring Your Own CVs"**
- Company creates a job role (via form OR AI avatar interview)
- Company forwards CVs to their HireInbox email address
- AI screens and scores every CV against role requirements
- Company reviews shortlist in dashboard
- **Pricing:** R1,750 per role (unlimited CVs)
- **No marketplace needed** - employer already has CVs

#### Phase 2: Job Listings (Months 4-6)
**"Post & Attract"**
- Companies can post jobs publicly on HireInbox
- Job seekers discover and apply
- All applications still screened by AI
- **Pricing:** R2,500 per job listing
- **Marketplace begins** - but we already have paying employers

#### Phase 3: Subscriptions (Month 7+)
**"All-You-Can-Hire"**
- Monthly subscription plans
- Unlimited roles and listings
- Full talent pool access
- Advanced features (AI interviews, scheduling)
- **Pricing:** R5,000-R15,000/month

### Why This Works

1. **No cold-start problem:** Phase 1 requires zero candidates
2. **Immediate value:** Employers save time on Day 1
3. **Proven demand:** Move to Phase 2 only when ready
4. **Cash flow positive:** Revenue from Day 1

### CV Ownership Model

**Critical decision:** Employer owns CVs they submit.

- CVs submitted by employer = employer's data
- To join talent pool = candidate must double opt-in
- POPIA compliant (consent-based)
- No "scraped CV" database

### Revenue Streams

#### B2B (Employers) - Per-Role Model

| Stream | Description | Price | Phase |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **AI CV Screening** | Per role, unlimited CVs, AI ranking, shortlist, ack emails | R1,750/role | 1 |

**Talent Pool Growth Strategy:**
- Employer screens 200 CVs, shortlists 10
- We ask: "Add the other 190 CVs to HireInbox Talent Pool?"
- Employer agrees → CVs join marketplace (with consent)
- Employer owns their CVs, but can donate unused ones
- This builds our talent pool WITHOUT cold-start problem
- POPIA compliant: employer consent + candidate can opt-out later

## Part 4: Pricing Strategy

> **CORE PRINCIPLE:** HireInbox is an AI Hiring Utility, NOT a marketplace.
> We charge **per role**, NOT per CV, because employers don't control CV volume.
> Per-role pricing feels fair and predictable.

### 4.1 B2B Pricing Philosophy

**Why Per-Role Pricing?**
1. **Fairness:** Employers can't control how many CVs they receive for a role
2. **Predictability:** Fixed cost per hire, easy to budget
3. **Simplicity:** No usage anxiety or "CV counting"
4. **Value-aligned:** Price matches the hiring outcome, not arbitrary volume

| Boutique AI Agent | R20,000/month | Custom-trained AI for specific company, knows company culture like a 5-year employee |

### 4.6 Pricing Justification

#### Why This Pricing Works

1. **Per-Role is Fair**
   - Employer posts 1 role, gets 5 or 500 CVs - same price
   - No punishment for being popular/well-known
   - Predictable budgeting for HR

2. **Value-Based Pricing**
   - R1,750 for a role that might receive 200 CVs = R8.75/CV (hidden value)
   - Traditional: 10 min/CV x 200 CVs = 33 hours of HR time saved
   - At R100/hour HR cost = R3,300 saved per role
   - ROI: 2x on first use

3. **Add-Ons are Optional, Not Gates**
   - Base product (screening) is complete on its own
   - Add-ons enhance, don't unlock essential features
   - Feels fair, not exploitative

4. **Competitive Positioning**

| Competitor | Model | Cost for 100 CVs | HireInbox |
|------------|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Talent Genie | Per-CV | R1,000+ | R1,750 (unlimited) |
| Job Crystal | % of salary | R15,000+ (15% of R100k) | R1,750 |
| Pnet | Job post + extras | R3,000+ | R1,750 |
| Indeed | Per-click/application | Variable (R2,000-5,000+) | R1,750 |

**Key insight:** For roles with high CV volume (100+), HireInbox becomes extremely cost-effective.
