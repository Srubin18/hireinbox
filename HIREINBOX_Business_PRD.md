## Strategic Positioning: AI Hiring Utility (NOT a Marketplace)

### The Cold-Start Problem

Traditional job boards face a chicken-and-egg problem:
- Employers won't post if there are no candidates
- Candidates won't join if there are no jobs
- Bootstrapping both sides simultaneously is expensive and slow

### Our Solution: Phase-Based Rollout

**HireInbox is NOT a job board.** We're an **AI Hiring Utility** - employers bring their own CVs, we provide AI-powered screening.

#### Phase 1: AI CV Analysis (Months 1-3)
**"Bring Your Own CVs"**
- Company creates a job role (via form OR AI avatar interview)
- Company forwards CVs to their HireInbox email address
- AI screens and scores every CV against role requirements
- Company reviews shortlist in dashboard
- **Pricing:** R1,750 per role (unlimited CVs)
- **No marketplace needed** - employer already has CVs

#### Phase 2: Job Listings (Months 4-6)
**"Post & Attract"**
- Companies can post jobs publicly on HireInbox
- Job seekers discover and apply
- All applications still screened by AI
- **Pricing:** R2,500 per job listing
- **Marketplace begins** - but we already have paying employers

#### Phase 3: Subscriptions (Month 7+)
**"All-You-Can-Hire"**
- Monthly subscription plans
- Unlimited roles and listings
- Full talent pool access
- Advanced features (AI interviews, scheduling)
- **Pricing:** R5,000-R15,000/month

### Why This Works

1. **No cold-start problem:** Phase 1 requires zero candidates
2. **Immediate value:** Employers save time on Day 1
3. **Proven demand:** Move to Phase 2 only when ready
4. **Cash flow positive:** Revenue from Day 1

### CV Ownership Model

**Critical decision:** Employer owns CVs they submit.

- CVs submitted by employer = employer's data
- To join talent pool = candidate must double opt-in
- POPIA compliant (consent-based)
- No "scraped CV" database

### Revenue Streams

#### B2B (Employers)

| Stream | Description | Price | Phase |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|
| CV Screening | Per role, unlimited CVs | R1,750/role | 1 |
| Talent Pool Opt-in | Employer permits unused CVs to join talent pool | Free (value exchange) | 1 |
| ID Verification | Verify candidate identity | R50/candidate | 1 |
| Credit Check | Financial background check | R100/candidate | 1 |
| Criminal Check | Background/criminal verification | R150/candidate | 1 |
| AI Interview + Psychometric | Avatar conducts first interview + rating + psychometric testing | R750/candidate | 1 |
| Job Listing | Post job publicly to attract candidates | R2,500/listing | 2 |
| Subscription | Unlimited roles + full talent pool access | R5,000-15,000/mo | 3 |
| Boutique AI Agent | Custom-trained AI for specific company | R20,000/month | 1+ |

**Talent Pool Growth Strategy:**
- Employer screens 200 CVs, shortlists 10
- We ask: "Add the other 190 CVs to HireInbox Talent Pool?"
- Employer agrees → CVs join marketplace (with consent)
- Employer owns their CVs, but can donate unused ones
- This builds our talent pool WITHOUT cold-start problem
- POPIA compliant: employer consent + candidate can opt-out later

|--------|-------|-------|
