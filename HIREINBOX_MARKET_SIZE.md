## PART 1: THE PAYING CUSTOMERS (B2B)

### 1.1 South African Business Landscape

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total MSMEs in SA | 2.0+ million | UNCTAD 2023 |
| Formal registered businesses | ~550,000 | Small Business Institute |
| SMEs (10-250 employees) | ~150,000 | StatsSA estimates |

- [StatsSA SMME Sector Report](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=17947)

### 1.2 B2B Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Calculation:**
```
75,000 SMEs hiring annually
× 5 roles per year (average)
× R1,750 per role
= R656,250,000 base CV screening

Add-ons (25% attach rate):
× R1,599 (Interview + Verification)
× 25%
= R149,906,250

Talent Pool Job Postings:
30,000 job posts × R2,500
= R75,000,000

B2B TAM = R881,156,250 (~R880 million)
```

**Conservative estimate including enterprise:** R1.75 billion

### 1.3 B2B Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

HireInbox targets SMEs with:
- 10-200 employees
- Technology-comfortable
- Based in major metros (Joburg, Cape Town, Durban)
- Service/professional sectors

**SAM Calculation:**
```
~30,000 target SMEs (40% of hiring SMEs)
× 4 roles/year
× R2,500 average transaction (incl. add-ons)
= R300,000,000

SAM = ~R300 million
```

### 1.4 Competition for B2B Spend

| Competitor | Estimated SA Market Share | Model |
|------------|---------------------------|-------|
| LinkedIn Recruiter | 25% | Subscription |
| Pnet/CareerJunction | 20% | Per listing |
| Indeed | 15% | CPC/CPA |
| Recruitment Agencies | 30% | % of salary |
| Other (DIY/referral) | 10% | Free |

**HireInbox differentiation:**
