# Project Status Check

Check the current status of HireInbox:

1. Read the CLAUDE.md file for context
2. Check if dev server is running (lsof -i :3000)
3. Check if any background tasks are running
4. Read the current todo list
5. Summarize what's done vs pending across all 5 buckets
6. Report any issues or blockers

Be concise - give me a quick status update.
