## Implementation Notes

This context should be embedded in:
1. **CV parsing prompts** - Recognize SA-specific terms
2. **Scoring algorithms** - Weight appropriately
3. **Evidence extraction** - Pull relevant SA achievements
4. **Candidate summaries** - Contextualize for hiring managers

The AI should be able to say:
> "Candidate completed CA(SA) articles at PwC (Big 4) and was cricket captain at Michaelhouse (top private school). This signals strong academics, leadership ability, and likely excellent professional network."

Not just:
> "Candidate has accounting qualification and played cricket."
