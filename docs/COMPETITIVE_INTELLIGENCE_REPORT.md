# The Opportunity Nobody Sees

## The Big Picture

Here's what most people miss about AI recruitment:

Everyone is building for Fortune 500 companies. HireVue charges $35,000 a year. Eightfold wants $200,000. Workday takes two years to implement.

Meanwhile, 99% of companies in Africa can't afford any of them. And nobody is building for them.

That's not a gap in the market. That's the entire market sitting there, waiting.

## What We're Up Against

### The Enterprise Players

**HireVue** is the name everyone knows. Founded in 2004, valued around $500M. They do AI video interviews, game-based assessments, 40+ languages. Impressive tech.

But here's the thing: their minimum deal is $35,000/year, and they won't talk to you unless you have 2,500+ employees. They're also fighting lawsuits over algorithmic bias. The EEOC is investigating them.

**Eightfold AI** raised enough money to become a unicorn ($2.1B valuation). They have a database of 1.6 billion career profiles. They focus exclusively on Fortune 500 companies. Their contracts start at $50,000 and go up to $200,000.

Neither of them has any presence in Africa. Neither of them cares about SMEs.

### The Mid-Market

**Greenhouse** and **Lever** are good products, but they're applicant tracking systems that bolted on AI later. They're not AI-native. They're designed for US companies with US hiring processes.

**Paradox** is interesting. Their chatbot Olivia does WhatsApp, SMS, and Messenger. Chipotle used them to cut time-to-hire from 12 days to 4. But they're still enterprise-focused, and they don't do CV screening — just scheduling and basic Q&A.

### Africa

There's no real competition here. Andela trains developers. Jobberman and BrighterMonday are job boards. Giraffe does mobile-first hiring for medium-skill roles.

Nobody is doing AI-powered CV screening for African SMEs. The market is wide open.

## The Numbers That Matter

**88%** of companies now use some form of AI for initial candidate screening. The market was $600M in 2023 and is heading to $3B+ by 2030.

AI video interviews alone are a $1 billion market this year, growing 25% annually.

Africa's HR tech market is worth $2 billion and growing 25% per year.

And here's the most important number: **90%** of communication in Africa happens on WhatsApp, not email.

Every enterprise recruitment tool was built for email. We're building for WhatsApp.

## What Actually Makes Us Different

Most AI hiring tools are black boxes. They give you a score — 78 out of 100 — and expect you to trust it. No explanation. No evidence. Just a number.

This creates three problems:

1. **Hiring managers don't trust it.** If you can't see why the AI made a decision, you second-guess it. The tool becomes a checkbox, not a decision-maker.

2. **Candidates get nothing.** 53.5% of job applicants receive zero feedback. They apply, they get rejected, they never know why.

3. **It's legally risky.** South Africa's POPIA law (Section 71) requires that automated decisions be explainable. If you can't explain it, you can't defend it.

We do something different. When our AI screens a CV, it shows you the exact quotes that match your requirements.

> "Managed a team of 12 sales representatives at Vodacom, achieving 142% of annual target in 2023"
> → Matches: Team leadership experience + Proven track record

You see the evidence. You make the call. That's how hiring should work.

No other platform does this. Not HireVue. Not Eightfold. Nobody.

## The Legal Landscape

AI hiring is a legal minefield, and most companies don't realise it yet.

**iTutorGroup** settled with the EEOC for $365,000 after their AI automatically rejected older applicants.

**Workday** is being sued for race and age discrimination in their AI screening. The interesting part: the lawsuit names Workday as the vendor, not just the employer. The courts are deciding whether AI vendors can be held liable for discrimination.

**HireVue and Intuit** are under EEOC investigation for disability discrimination.

The legal principle emerging is simple: *"If the AI did it, the employer did it."* You can't hide behind algorithms.

A University of Washington study found that AI resume screeners preferred white-associated names 85% of the time. Male names were preferred 52% of the time, female names only 11%.

This is why evidence-based AI matters. When you can show exactly why you rejected someone — or why you didn't — you have a defensible position. When all you have is a score, you're exposed.

## The WhatsApp Opportunity

This is the insight that changes everything.

In South Africa, email is for corporates. Maybe 10% of hiring happens via email. The other 90% happens on WhatsApp — job posts shared in groups, CVs sent as PDFs, interviews scheduled via voice note.

Every recruitment tool in the world was built for email. Greenhouse, Lever, Workday — they all assume email is the primary channel.

We're building for WhatsApp first.

Paradox proved this works. Ocado hired candidates in under 30 minutes using WhatsApp automation. The conversion rates are 3x better than email. Response times go from days to minutes.

The first company to crack WhatsApp hiring in Africa owns the market.

## The Path to a Billion Rand

Look at what HR tech unicorns have in common:

**Gusto** ($9.6B) made payroll simple for SMEs.
**Deel** ($12B) made global hiring possible without entities.
**Rippling** ($13.5B) unified HR and IT in one platform.

The pattern is always the same:

1. Solve a painful problem
2. Start with SMEs (they move fast)
3. Become infrastructure, not just a tool
4. Build network effects (more users = more value)

HireInbox follows the same playbook:

**2026:** Dominate South Africa. 5,000 customers. R33M ARR.
**2027:** Expand to Nigeria, Kenya. 20,000 customers. R170M ARR.
**2028:** Become the platform. 50,000+ customers. R300M+ ARR.

The maths works. A SaaS company at R300M ARR with 25% growth is worth R2-3 billion. That's unicorn territory in Rand terms.

## The Risks We're Watching

**Global player enters Africa.** If HireVue or Eightfold decides to build an SME product for Africa, they have more resources than us. Mitigation: Move fast, build the data moat before they arrive.

**AI regulation tightens.** Europe is already regulating AI in hiring. Africa will follow. Mitigation: We're already POPIA compliant. Evidence-based AI is the most defensible approach.

**OpenAI costs spike.** We're dependent on GPT-4o. If prices double, our margins shrink. Mitigation: Optimise prompts, build fallback to Claude or open-source models.

**Copycat competitors.** Once we prove the model works, others will copy it. Mitigation: Data moat. Every CV we process makes our AI smarter. Local context is hard to replicate.

## What We Need to Build

**Already done:**
- AI CV screening with evidence
- SA-specific intelligence (understanding CA(SA), BCom, local companies)
- POPIA-compliant architecture

**Next 90 days:**
- User authentication and payments
- Free tier (prove value before charging)
- Production deployment

**2025 H1:**
- WhatsApp integration
- AI Video Interviews
- Talent Pool marketplace

**2025 H2:**
- Pan-African expansion (Nigeria, Kenya)
- API platform (let others build on us)
- Salary benchmarking data product

## The Bottom Line

The opportunity is straightforward:

1. AI recruitment is a $600M market going to $3B
2. Nobody owns Africa
3. Enterprise tools are priced out of reach for 99% of companies
4. WhatsApp is the communication channel, not email
5. Evidence-based AI is legally defensible and builds trust

We're not building a feature. We're not building a nice-to-have.

We're building infrastructure for how Africa hires.

The question isn't whether this market will be worth billions. It will.

The question is whether we execute fast enough to own it.
