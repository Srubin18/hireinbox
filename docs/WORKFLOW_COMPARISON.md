**Date:** 25 January 2026
**Purpose:** Step-by-step comparison of actual user journeys

---

## PART 1: EMPLOYER/BUSINESS WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Discovery & First Impression

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Google search** | Top results, ads | Top results, ads | #1 for jobs | Not ranking |
| **Landing page load** | <2 sec | <2 sec | <1 sec | ~3 sec |
| **Instant clarity** | "All-in-one HR platform" | "The hiring platform you need" | "Post jobs, find candidates" | "Less noise. Better hires." (??) |
| **See product** | Screenshots, video | Screenshots, video | Screenshots | Nothing |
| **Trust signals** | 30k companies, Forbes badge | NFL, Coursera logos | 345M candidates | None |
| **Pricing visible** | Link in nav | Link in nav | Clear per-post pricing | Hidden |

**HireInbox Gap:** User lands confused. No idea what product does. No reason to trust. No proof of value.

---

### Step 2: Signup Process

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **CTA button** | "Start free trial" | "Request demo" | "Post a job" | "Get Started" |
| **Fields required** | Email, company, name | Email, company, size, phone | Email, company | Email, password only |
| **Company verification** | Email domain check | Sales qualification | Basic | None |
| **Welcome email** | Immediate, branded | Immediate + sales follow-up | Immediate | Basic confirmation |
| **Time to account** | 30 seconds | 1-2 days (demo first) | 30 seconds | 30 seconds |

**HireInbox Gap:** No company name collected. No verification. Don't know who signed up.

---

### Step 3: Onboarding Experience

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **First screen** | Guided setup wizard | Dedicated onboarding call | Post your first job | Empty dashboard |
| **Progress indicator** | "Step 1 of 4" | Account manager guides | Checklist shown | Nothing |
| **Video tutorial** | Embedded in flow | Personalized training | Help articles | None |
| **First action prompted** | "Create your first job" | "Let's set up your pipeline" | "Post a job now" | User must figure it out |
| **Help available** | Chat widget, docs | Dedicated support | Help center | Support button |
| **Time to first value** | 5 minutes | 1 day (but hand-held) | 10 minutes | Unknown (users get lost) |

**HireInbox Gap:** User lands on empty dashboard with no guidance. Most will leave.

---

### Step 4: Creating a Job/Role

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Start action** | Big "Create job" button | Prominent "Add job" | "Post a job" banner | Small "+ New Role" in corner |
| **Job templates** | 100+ industry templates | Custom templates per company | AI suggestions | None |
| **Required fields** | Title, dept, location | Title, team, hiring manager | Title, location, salary | Title, description, requirements |
| **AI assistance** | AI writes description | AI optimization suggestions | AI-generated descriptions | None |
| **Preview** | Full preview before post | Preview with branding | Preview as candidate sees | Basic preview |
| **Confirmation** | "Job posted!" celebration | Pipeline created notification | "Job is live!" | Modal closes |

**HireInbox Gap:** No templates, no AI help writing jobs, action is hidden.

---

### Step 5: Receiving Applications

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Application source** | Careers page, job boards, integrations | Careers page, 400+ integrations | Indeed network | User's email inbox (IMAP) |
| **Setup required** | None (auto careers page) | IT setup or Greenhouse hosted | None | Manual IMAP configuration |
| **Technical knowledge** | None needed | Minimal | None needed | Must know IMAP server, port, SSL |
| **Applicant notification** | Automatic "we received your CV" | Automatic, customizable | Automatic | Must configure separately |
| **Time to receive first CV** | Immediate if job posted | Immediate | Immediate | After email setup works |

**HireInbox Gap:** IMAP setup is a massive barrier. 80%+ of SME users won't know how to do this.

---

### Step 6: Screening Candidates

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **View applications** | Clean inbox view | Kanban pipeline | List view | Card view |
| **AI screening** | AI match scores | AI recommendations | Smart Sourcing AI | AI scores with evidence |
| **See why matched** | Basic reasons | Scorecard based | Skills match | **FULL QUOTES FROM CV** |
| **Bulk actions** | Yes (reject 50 at once) | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| **Filter/search** | Advanced filters | Saved searches | Filters | Basic |
| **Comparison view** | Side-by-side | Scorecard comparison | None | None |

**HireInbox Advantage:** Evidence-based AI showing exact quotes is genuinely better than competitors.

---

### Step 7: Shortlisting & Next Steps

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Move to shortlist** | Drag to stage | Click to advance | Star/save | "Shortlist" button |
| **Notify candidate** | Auto email | Auto email, customizable | Auto email | Manual or none |
| **Schedule interview** | Built-in scheduler | Calendar integration | Indeed Interview | Not built |
| **Video interview** | Built-in or integration | Integration | Indeed Interview | Partial (AI interview exists) |
| **Collaborate with team** | Comments, @mentions, ratings | Scorecards, team feedback | Basic sharing | None |

**HireInbox Gap:** After screening, workflow dead-ends. No interview scheduling, no team collaboration.

---

### Step 8: Making the Hire

| Step | Workable | Greenhouse | Indeed | HireInbox |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Offer management** | Built-in offer letters | Offer approval workflow | External | Not built |
| **Background checks** | Integrations (Checkr, etc) | Integrations | External | UI mockup only |
| **Onboarding** | Built-in HR onboarding | Handoff to HRIS | External | Not built |
| **Analytics** | Time to hire, source tracking | Detailed reports | Basic | Basic stats |
| **Mark as hired** | Status update, triggers | Closes job, updates reports | Manual | Not tracked |

**HireInbox Gap:** No end-to-end workflow. Screening is isolated from actual hiring.

---

### EMPLOYER WORKFLOW SUMMARY

| Stage | World-Class | HireInbox | Verdict |
|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Discovery | Clear, trustworthy | Confusing, no trust | FAIL |
| Signup | Smooth, verified | Works but basic | PARTIAL |
| Onboarding | Guided, delightful | Non-existent | FAIL |
| Job creation | Easy, AI-assisted | Hidden, manual | FAIL |
| Receiving CVs | Automatic | Complex IMAP setup | FAIL |
| Screening | Good AI | **EXCELLENT AI** | WIN |
| Next steps | Full workflow | Dead end | FAIL |
| Hiring | Integrated | Not built | FAIL |

**HireInbox employer workflow is 1/8 world-class.** Only screening works well.

---

## PART 2: CANDIDATE/JOB SEEKER WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Discovery

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **How they find you** | Everyone knows LinkedIn | Google "jobs near me" | Developer word of mouth | SA job search | ??? |
| **SEO ranking** | #1 for professional | #1 for jobs | Good for "dev jobs SA" | Good for "jobs SA" | Not ranking |
| **Brand recognition** | Universal | Universal | Tech community | SA household name | Zero |
| **First impression** | Professional network | Job search engine | Dev talent marketplace | Job board | Unknown product |

**HireInbox Gap:** No candidate acquisition strategy. How do they find you?

---

### Step 2: Understanding the Value

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **What they offer** | Network + jobs + learning | Job search + apply | Companies find you | Job listings + CV hosting | CV scan + feedback |
| **Clear in 5 seconds** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Free vs paid** | Clear (basic free) | Clear (free for candidates) | Free for developers | Free for candidates | Unclear |
| **Why use this** | Everyone's here | Most jobs | Best dev salaries | SA jobs | "Better CVs"? |

**HireInbox Gap:** Value proposition unclear. "Get AI feedback on your CV" isn't compelling vs "find a job."

---

### Step 3: Creating Account/Profile

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Signup required to start** | Yes | No (can search first) | Yes | No (can search) | No (can scan CV) |
| **Profile depth** | Extensive (education, jobs, skills) | Basic (resume upload) | Detailed (skills, salary, preferences) | CV upload + basic info | None (no profile) |
| **Time to complete** | 20-30 min for good profile | 2 min | 15-20 min | 5-10 min | 0 min (no account needed) |
| **Value of profile** | Network effects, visibility | Apply to jobs faster | Companies contact you | Recruiters find you | Nothing (not stored) |

**HireInbox Gap:** No account = no relationship. One-time scan, then gone forever.

---

### Step 4: CV Upload & Analysis

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **CV upload** | Parse to profile fields | Store for applications | Parse to profile | Store for applications | Upload for scan |
| **AI feedback** | Basic optimization tips | Resume review service ($) | Salary benchmark | None | **DETAILED AI ANALYSIS** |
| **What you learn** | "Add more skills" | "Paid review available" | "You're worth R850k" | Nothing | Strengths, gaps, improvements |
| **Actionable** | Somewhat | If you pay | Very (salary data) | No | Yes (specific fixes) |

**HireInbox Advantage:** AI feedback is genuinely valuable and free. Better than competitors here.

---

### Step 5: Finding Jobs

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Job listings** | Millions | Millions | Thousands (curated) | Thousands | ZERO |
| **Search quality** | Excellent | Excellent | Curated for you | Good | N/A |
| **Filters** | Location, salary, remote, etc | Extensive | Skill-based | Standard | N/A |
| **Job alerts** | Email, push, in-app | Email, push | Email | Email | N/A |
| **Apply ease** | 1-click with profile | 1-click or redirect | Companies apply to you | Click to apply | N/A |

**HireInbox Gap:** NO JOBS. Candidates get CV feedback but then... what? Nothing.

---

### Step 6: Getting Matched to Opportunities

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Matching algorithm** | AI matches you to jobs | AI job recommendations | Companies matched to you | Basic matching | "Talent Pool" (FAKE) |
| **Employer outreach** | InMail from recruiters | Employer messages | Interview requests | Recruiter contact | Nothing (no employers) |
| **Response rate** | Variable | Variable | 98% (claim) | Variable | 0% (no matches exist) |
| **Quality of matches** | Mixed | Mixed | High (curated) | Mixed | N/A |

**HireInbox Gap:** Talent Pool is fake. Zero employers, zero matches, zero value after CV scan.

---

### Step 7: Application Tracking

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Track applications** | "Applied" tab | "My Jobs" dashboard | Interview pipeline | Basic tracking | Not built |
| **Status updates** | Some employers update | Some employers update | High engagement | Variable | N/A |
| **Interview scheduling** | Via messages | Via messages | Built-in | Via messages | N/A |
| **Feedback on rejection** | Rare | Rare | Often provided | Rare | N/A |

**HireInbox Gap:** No application tracking because no applications exist.

---

### Step 8: Returning Value

| Step | LinkedIn | Indeed | OfferZen | Pnet | HireInbox |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Why come back** | Network, learning, jobs | New jobs daily | Salary updates, new offers | New jobs | No reason |
| **Notification frequency** | Daily/weekly | Daily | When companies interested | Weekly | None |
| **Career progression** | Learning, connections | Job upgrades | Salary benchmarks | Job changes | One-time scan |
| **Lifetime value** | Years of engagement | Years of searches | Until hired (then pause) | Years | Minutes |

**HireInbox Gap:** No reason to return. Scan CV once, get feedback, leave forever.

---

### CANDIDATE WORKFLOW SUMMARY

| Stage | World-Class | HireInbox | Verdict |
|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Discovery | Strong brand, SEO | No presence | FAIL |
| Value understanding | Clear proposition | Confusing | FAIL |
| Account creation | Valuable profile | No account | FAIL |
| CV analysis | Basic or paid | **EXCELLENT** | WIN |
| Finding jobs | Millions of listings | Zero jobs | FAIL |
| Getting matched | Active matching | Fake/empty | FAIL |
| Tracking | Dashboard | Not built | FAIL |
| Returning | High engagement | No reason | FAIL |

**HireInbox candidate workflow is 1/8 world-class.** Only CV analysis is good.

## PART 4: THE BRUTAL TRUTH

### For Employers

**What works:**
- AI CV screening with evidence (genuinely better than competitors)
- SA-specific context (unique advantage)
- Per-role pricing (simpler than alternatives)

**What's broken:**
- No way to discover HireInbox
- Homepage doesn't explain product
- No onboarding
- IMAP setup is a barrier
- No workflow after screening
- No interview scheduling
- No team collaboration
- No offer management
- No integrations

**Competitor advantage:**
Workable/Greenhouse have 100x more features and a complete workflow. HireInbox does one thing but the journey before and after is broken.

### For Candidates

**What works:**
- AI CV feedback (genuinely useful)
- Free to use
- Quick results

**What's broken:**
- No way to discover HireInbox
- No jobs to apply to (CRITICAL)
- No profile saved
- No matching
- No reason to return
- Talent pool is fake

**Competitor advantage:**
Indeed/LinkedIn have jobs. HireInbox has... feedback? That's not why job seekers show up.

## PART 5: WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE

### Employer Workflow Fixes

| Priority | Fix | Effort | Impact |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| P0 | Rewrite homepage to explain product | 2 hours | HIGH |
| P0 | Add onboarding wizard | 4 hours | HIGH |
| P0 | Simplify email setup (Gmail 1-click) | 1 day | HIGH |
| P1 | Add interview scheduling | 2 days | MEDIUM |
| P1 | Add team collaboration | 2 days | MEDIUM |
| P2 | Add integrations (Gmail, Outlook, Slack) | 1 week | MEDIUM |
| P2 | Add offer management | 3 days | LOW |

### Candidate Workflow Fixes

| Priority | Fix | Effort | Impact |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| P0 | Fix talent pool to actually save data | 4 hours | HIGH |
| P0 | Create candidate accounts | 4 hours | HIGH |
| P1 | Add job listings (even if manual/curated) | 2 days | HIGH |
| P1 | Enable employer → candidate matching | 3 days | HIGH |
| P2 | Add job alerts | 1 day | MEDIUM |
| P2 | Add application tracking | 2 days | MEDIUM |

### The Core Problem

**HireInbox is a feature, not a product.**

- AI CV screening is a feature
- A product is a complete workflow from start to finish

**To become a product:**
1. Employer workflow: Discover → Signup → Create job → Receive CVs → Screen → Interview → Hire
2. Candidate workflow: Discover → Upload CV → Get feedback → Find jobs → Apply → Get hired

Both workflows are currently broken after step 4-5.

---

## CONCLUSION

| Metric | World-Class | HireInbox | Gap |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Employer workflow completion | 100% | 25% | 75% |
| Candidate workflow completion | 100% | 15% | 85% |
| Time to value (employer) | 5 minutes | Unknown (often fails) | CRITICAL |
| Time to value (candidate) | 2 minutes | 2 minutes (then dead end) | CRITICAL |
| Reason to return | Many | None | CRITICAL |

**The AI screening is world-class. Everything around it is not.**

Fix the wrapper. The engine is good.

*"People don't buy products, they buy better versions of themselves."*

*Right now, HireInbox doesn't help employers HIRE or candidates GET HIRED. It just... screens.*
