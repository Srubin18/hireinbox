## THE SCRIPT (60 seconds)

```
[0-3s] HOOK
"Brands rejected me 47 times. Then I found out the truth."

[3-8s] THE PROBLEM
"They weren't looking at my content. They were looking
at my METRICS. And they didn't trust them."
[Show: Screenshot of analytics, red X overlays]

[8-15s] THE PAIN
"1 in 4 influencers buy fake followers. Brands lost
2 BILLION dollars to fraud last year. So now? They
trust NO ONE."
[Show: Headlines about influencer fraud]

[15-22s] THE FRUSTRATION
"You're REAL. Your audience is REAL. But you look
exactly like the fakes. No verification. No proof.
Just vibes."
[Frustrated hand gestures, quick cuts]

[22-30s] THE SHIFT
"I was tired of sending PDFs that brands never opened.
So I tried something different."
[Transition: Dark → Light, music shifts]

[30-45s] THE SOLUTION
"Creator Passport. One link. AI-verified.
It analyzes your VIDEO — not just your numbers.
How you speak. Your energy. Your authenticity.
Stuff bots CAN'T fake."
[Show: Passport interface, video analysis, scores]

[45-55s] THE PROOF
"My first brand deal after getting verified?
Closed in 3 days. They said: 'Finally, someone
we can actually trust.'"
[Show: DM screenshot or testimonial]

[55-60s] CTA
"Link in bio. R49. Takes 2 minutes.
Stop looking like a bot. Start getting paid."
[Show: QR code or URL, confident look to camera]
```

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS (A/B TEST)

### Hook 1: The Rant
> "I'm so tired of brands asking for my 'media kit' and then ghosting me. You know what they're actually doing? Googling 'how to spot fake influencers' and checking if YOU match the red flags."

### Hook 2: The Call-Out
> "If you're a real creator with real followers and you're STILL not getting brand deals — it's not your content. It's your credibility. Or lack of it."

### Hook 3: The Flip
> "What if I told you brands WANT to work with you... but their legal team says no because they can't verify you're real?"

### Hook 4: The Storytime
> "Story time: A brand told me they loved my content but couldn't work with me. When I asked why, they said 'we got burned by fake influencers before.' That's when I realized..."

### Hook 5: The Tutorial Fake-Out
> "How to get more brand deals in 2025: Step 1 — prove you're not a fraud. Wait, what?"

## CAPTION (YouTube/TikTok)

```
Brands rejected me 47 times. Then I found out why.

They don't trust your numbers anymore. 1 in 4 influencers buy fake followers. Brands lost $2 BILLION to fraud.

So I got AI-verified. Creator Passport analyzes your VIDEO — your energy, authenticity, presence. Stuff bots can't fake.

First brand deal after? Closed in 3 days.

R49. Link in bio. Stop looking like a bot.
